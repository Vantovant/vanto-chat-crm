2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in top-right corner)
4. Click **Load unpacked**
5. Select the `chrome-extension` folder
6. Open **https://web.whatsapp.com**

### Important Notes

- WhatsApp Web DOM selectors may change with updates — if the sidebar stops detecting contacts, the extension may need an update

---

## 14. Troubleshooting

### I can't log in

- Make sure you're using the correct email and password
- If you forgot your password, use the **Reset Password** link on the login page
- Contact your team admin if you don't have an account

### Messages aren't sending

- Check the **Integrations → WhatsApp** panel for connection status
- Verify that your Twilio account is active and has credits
- Check if the phone number is in correct E.164 format (e.g., `+27821234567`)
- Look at the message status — if it shows "failed," hover to see the error

### Contacts showing as duplicates

- Go to **Contacts** and select both duplicate entries
- Click **Merge** to combine them
- The system uses phone number normalization to prevent future duplicates

### AI responses are inaccurate

- Upload more relevant documents to the **Knowledge Vault**
- Use **strict** mode collections for information that must be quoted exactly
- Be specific in your questions

### Chrome Extension not showing

- Make sure Developer mode is enabled in `chrome://extensions`
- Verify the extension is loaded and enabled
- Refresh the WhatsApp Web page
- Check that you're on `web.whatsapp.com` (not the desktop app)

### Unread count is wrong

- The sidebar badge shows the total unread count across all conversations
- Open a conversation and it will automatically mark as read
- The count updates in real-time via database subscriptions
